      The user wants a responsive web interface to see a particular comment from the mySidewalk engagement comments API. Load the comment with ID 100 (<a href="https://mysidewalk.com/api/engagement/v1/comments/100.json">https://mysidewalk.com/api/engagement/v1/comments/100.json</a>) from the API, redirect the windowâ€™s location to a path that represents a human friendly portion of the comment, and display the comment in a device response and visually pleasing manner.
